This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Face detection-project

This repository contains the frontend for my face-detection project. I use the general model from [Clarifai-api](https://www.clarifai.com/).
The general model gives concepts in your image. Upload an image and see what it's about. It's quite accurate (and fun) :+1:.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
